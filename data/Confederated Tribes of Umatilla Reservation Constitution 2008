CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS
OF THE 
CONFEDERATED TRIBES OF THE UMATILLA INDIAN RESERVATION

 
 We, the people of the Umatilla Indian Reservation do hereby ordain and establish this 
Constitution and Bylaws.
 
 

ARTICLE I - NAME

 
 The tribal government shall be called the "Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian 
Reservation" (“Confederated Tribes” or “CTUIR”), and shall include Indians of the Cayuse, 
Umatilla, and Walla Walla Tribes.
 
 

ARTICLE II - PURPOSE

 
 The purpose and powers of the Confederated Tribes shall be, within law, to exercise and protect 
all existing and future tribal rights arising from any source whether treaty, federal statute, state 
statute, common law, or otherwise; to achieve a maximum degree of self-government in all tribal 
affairs; and to protect and promote the interests of the Indians of the Umatilla Indian 
Reservation.
 
 

ARTICLE III - TREATY RIGHTS AND THE FEDERAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITY

 
 This Constitution and Bylaws is not adopted under the Indian Reorganization Act, also known as 
the "Wheeler-Howard Act." No tribal right of any kind shall be weakened, impaired, or 
surrendered by the adoption of this Constitution and Bylaws. The adoption of this Constitution 
and Bylaws does not in any way reduce the trust obligation of the United States to the 
Confederated Tribes.

The membership of the Confederated Tribes shall consist, as follows, of:
 
 

ARTICLE IV - MEMBERS

 
 (a) 

All persons of Indian blood whose names appear on the official census roll of the 
Confederated Tribes as of July 1, 1949; provided, that corrections may be made in said 
roll by the General Council within five (5) years from the adoption and approval of this 
Constitution and Bylaws, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative.

(b) 

Persons who:

(1) 

Have at least one parent or grandparent who is an enrolled member of the 
Confederated Tribes, and

(2)  Have at least one-fourth (1/4) degree of Indian blood from any federally 

recognized Indian tribe within the United States.

(c) 

No new applicants for membership in the Confederated Tribes under Article IV(c) shall 
be enrolled. Persons already enrolled under the former Article IV(c) retain their 
membership under the same terms as the original Article IV(c): they are authorized “to 
participate in tribal government and to vote and to hold office” but they “shall not 
participate in any right or claim arising out of the treaties to which the Confederated 
Tribes are a party.”

SECTION 1.
