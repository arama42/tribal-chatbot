Section III â€” Business Program and objectives:

A. A. To set up protective measures to guarantee the pursuit of happiness 

and to safeguard the econonic interests of the Shoshone and Arapahoe 
Indians; to protect them in their tribal customs as Indians, and 
to offer such guarantees as to freedom in religious worship that 
might be jeopardized otherwise, due to their segregation as Indians; 
to formulate and introduce plans for social, educational and economic 
programs for the advancement and betterment of living conditions 
affecting the Shoshone and Arapahoe people.

B. Enrollment matters not otherwise cared for by this Constitution 

and By-laws will be dealt with by the general council.

C. To establish a revolving bank fund sufficiently large to take care 

of the needs of those Indians who are anxious to build homes; also, 
to provide reimbursable loans for those needing farming equipment, 
livestock, etc., in order that as many as possible may become self
supporting.

All applicants for reimbursable loans, before they can secure a 
Ioan under this reimbursable plan, must furnish evidence that they 
have fully satisfied all their previous loans.

D. 

Land Acquisition: To make it possible for our landless Indians to 
obtain reimbursable loans from the bank to acquire lands on which 
to build a home and for farming purposes, offering the land so 
purchased as security for the repayment of the loan. No loan for 
this purpose to be in excess of $600.00. It is recommended that 
lands obtained for this purpose be heirship lands wherever possible 
in order to simplify our heirship situation. An heir having an 
interest in a suitable heirship allotment can have first preference 
in buying the allotment under this reimbursable plan if he so 
desires. All proposed purchases must be thoroughly Investigated 
by the Agency officials before the loan is granted.

An equal number of loans are to be granted to each tribe.

If purchaser of this land neglects or refuses to make his pay
ments under his reimbursable agreement and falls behind more than 
a year on said payments, it is recommended that the Government with 
the consent of the Business Council retake the land and improvements 
and turn it over to another landless Indian for the payments due. 
On a maximum loan it is recommended that the reimbursable payments 
extend evenly over a period often (10) years. It is recommended 
that 3% (three per cent) Interest be charged on those loans for 
land purchases in order that a fund be created and that said fund 
so created be used only for the relief of indigent Indians.

In the event of $50,000 revolving reimbursable fund being estab
lished, it is recommended that not over $15,000 be outstanding on 
loan* for acquisition of lands at any one time.

It is further recommended that members of the Business Council pass 
on all applications for reimbursable loans on the reimbursable bank.

E. 

Educational Program: It is proposed that a fund of $5,000 be set 

aside for the purpose of asking reimbursable loans to promising 
young Indians for higher and vocational educational purposes. A 
maximum loan is suggested of $200.00 yearly for any one individual, 
it being understood that those securing this class of loans make re
payment during their summer vacations and upon completion of the 
courses taken.

F. All associations and organisations of a tribal nature are subject 
to the review by/the recommendations of the Business Council.

times on the leading phases of the Departments of Health, Finance 
and Business, Education and Employment, Welfare, Agriculture, 
Irrigation, Lands and leases, Roads, Industry, Forestry, and CCC-ID, 
and the Law and Order Regulations, on this reservation; and to make 

such recommendations as any be of assistance in the advancement of 
the administration of those various departments, for the benefit of 
the Shoshone and Arapahoe people.
