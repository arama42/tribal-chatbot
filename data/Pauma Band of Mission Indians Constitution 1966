other tribe or band" is a person who, because of his affiliation with the other

ers and duties hereinafter described. Members of the Business Committee shall serve 
a term of two (2) years or until their successors are duly elected and installed.

Sec. 4. Elections. Any enrolled member of the Band, twenty-one (21) years of age

elections of officers shall be by secret ballot. Nominations for the Business Com
mittee shall be made at a General Council meeting called for that purpose, and all 
nominees certified by the existing Business Committee shall have their names placed 
on the ballot. All nominations, and elections, whether for officers or by way of 
referendum, shall be conducted in accordance with an ordinance or ordinances adopted 
by the governing body which shall provide for the dates thereof, for polling places, 
election committees and their duties, absentee balloting, and other necessary re
quirements.

any tribal official from office who fails to carry out his Business Committee respon
sibilities or is found guilty of a felony in any County, State, or Federal Court, or 
for gross neglect of duty, or misconduct reflecting on the dignity and integrity of 
the Band.

for the recall of an officer, the Business Committee shall examine the petition and 
if properly signed by a sufficient number of voters, the Council shall hold a recall 
election within sixty (60) days after receipt of petition.

statement of all charges filed against him at least ten (10) days before a meeting of 
the General Council at which he is to appear and he shall be given a fair opportunity 
to answer any and all written charges at such meeting. A majority of those voting

 Area Director, Sacramento, California 95825

Dear Mr. Finale:

We have reviewed the Articles of Association adopted by the Pauma Band of Mission 

Indians on March 17, 1966, and transmitted to us on December 8, 1967.

The Articles of Association of the Pauma Band of Mission Indians are hereby ap
proved and become effective this date with certain understandings. We urge the coun
cil promptly to adopt a resolution confirming our understandings in order that future 
interpretations of the document will be made accordingly. In view of this, a copy 
of this approval letter and the resolution accepting these understandings should be 
made a part of each copy of the governing document. We have referred to the numbered 
paragraphs as articles.

Article 2.

Section (a) 3. of this article provides for adoptions to be approved by the Bureau 

of Indian Affairs, We interpret this to mean the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative.

Likewise, since persons otherwise qualified cannot be denied membership because 
of what they may have duly inherited, we understand that property received through 
inheritance is not meant to be included within the meaning of the definition contained 
in Section B.

Article 3.

There is some question concerning the status of the fourth member of the business 

committee. Even though the article outlining the duties of officers is silent on 
this matter, we interpret Article 3 to mean there are four officers constituting 
the business committee, i.e., chairman, vice-chairman, secretary‚Äîtreasurer, and a 
committee-man. We understand, therefore, that the term "officer‚Äù wherever referred 
to in the document will apply to any of the four members of the business committee,

Article 4.

The language "any enrolled member of the band‚Äù as a definition for eligible voters 
is inconsistent with Article 3. Since it may be some time before a roll is prepared, 
we understand "any enrolled member" to mean anyone eligible for enrollment as well 
as one who may actually be listed on a roll of members.

We are returning herewith for appropriate distribution, the signed original and 

four copies of the Pauma Articles of Association.

As the group operates under this document, changes can be made pursuant to Arti

cle 10 and as dictated by usage.

CC: Area Field Representative,

Riverside Field Office

(Sgd) T.W. TAYLOR,

Deputy Commissioner
