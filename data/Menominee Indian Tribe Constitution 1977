Indian Reservation, including any land which may hereafter be added to the 
Reservation under any law of the United States. The governmental powers of

relief pending further investigation and hearings in the case. If the

of justice, appoint an unbiased commission to investigate the charges further 
and to present any evidence gathered to the Court at a hearing at which both 
sides in the case have opportunity to be heard, to present evidence and to 
question the commission. At the conclusion of all hearings, the Court shall

question and ordering a new election to be held.

authorize its Tribal Legislature to waive, or limit the right of 
the Tribe or the Successor Business to sovereign immunity from 
suit, except as specifically provided in this subsection; nor does 
it waive or limit, or authorize its Tribal Legislature to waive or 
limit any exceptions and immunities from taxation to which the 
Successor Business is or may in the future be entitled, and to

placement, and for sinking fund or a reserve to retire the 
principal obligation on the bond indentures named in subsec
tion (d) (1) of this section.

(3)  Excess profits shall then be divided by the 

Board of Directors on an equitable basis between an amount to be 
retained by the Successor Business (hereafter '‘retained share”)

Tribal Legislature, representing the Tribe (hereafter “tribal 
share"). In making the division between the retained share and 
the tribal share, the Board of Directors shall consult exten
sively with the Tribal Legislature and shall be guided by indus
try standards.

(4)  The Tribal Legislature shall then determine 

whether the tribal share shall be utilized for tribal opera
tions, distributed to tribal members, or divided and used for 
both purposes. In making its determination as to the distribu
tion of the tribal share, the Tribal Legislature shall use its 
best judgement and shall carefully consider both the need for 
effective tribal operations and the individual financial needs 
of tribal members.
