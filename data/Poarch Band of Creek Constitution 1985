Mr. Robert Benn 
Superintendent, Choctaw Agency

Dear Mr. Benn:

In accordance with Federal regulations at 25 CFR Part 81.5(f), the authorization to 
call a Secretarial election for the purpose of adopting (or rejecting) an appropriate 
constitution for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians which was issued on July 8, 1985, 
was void 90 days from the date of issuance. According to our calculation, the 
authorization expired on October 7, 1985, without an indication from the Poarch 
Band accepting our recommended modifications to the document submitted on 
January 30, 1985. Because an appropriate constitution is critical to the furtherance 
of the political relationship which should exist between the Federal Government and 
a Federally-recognized Indian tribe, we are extending the regulatory time limits of 
25 CFR Part 81.5(f).

The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. 476, provides that "Any Indian tribe, 
or tribes, residing on the same reservation, shall have the right to organize for its 
common welfare, and may adopt an appropriate constitution and bylaws, which shall 
become effective when ratified by a majority vote of the adult members of the tribe, 
or of the adult Indians residing on such reservation, as the case may be, at a special 
election authorized and called by the Secretary of the Interior under such rules and 
regulations as he may prescribe . . . ." The Band disseminated on July 1, 1985, a 
document which purports to be an "approved" constitution of the Poarch Band of 
Creek Indians but which has not been approved by the Secretary and, in our opinion, 
is not appropriate.

Our primary concerns about the proposed constitution which has now apparently been 
disseminated as "approved" relate to the fictionalized representation in Article I 
that persons listed as â€™Indian" on the 1870 and 1900 censuses are fullblood Creek 
Indians. The fictionalized representation regarding blood quantum makes the proposed 
constitution inappropriate for Secretarial approval. The 1934 Indian Reorganization 
Act authorizes the Secretary to approve only appropriate constitutions. If the 
Poarch Band is insistent on using the early censuses as its base roll and arbitrarily 
designating persons listed as "Indian" thereon as fullblood Creek Indians in its proposed 
constitution, the Secretary will not approve nor accord validity to the proposed 
constitution.

The acknowledgement process which resulted in the determination that the Poarch 
Band of Creek Indians exists as an Indian tribe found, inter alia, that the petitioning 
group's membership standards and blood quantum statistics were acceptable for tribal 
purposes. Indeed, in the final acknowledgement notice appearing in the Federal 
Register of June 11, 1984, the following language appears:

Blood quantum statistics concerning the Poarch Band of Creeks 
which are found within the proposed finding, specifically on 
page 7 of both the memorandum of recommendation and its 
attached genealogical technical report, are solely for tribal 
membership purposes. Once acknowledged under 25 CFR Part 
83, the Bureau's Tribal Enrollment staff will provide specific 
guidance in computing more factual blood quantums of persons 
named on the tribe's basic membership roll for use in certifying 
individual members for Federal purposes. Blood quantums 
computed for tribal purposes may not necessarily agree with 
those computed for Federal purposes.

Clearly, it was never contemplated that the identical membership standards and blood 
quantum computations found acceptable solely for tribal purposes should become 
institutionalized in the Band's constitution. Instead, the Bureau anticipated that 
the Band would be amenable to our offer of assistance in correcting patent 
inaccuracies in blood quantum computations and resolving membership standards in 
order that the Band's constitution would be appropriate for Secretarial approval.

An appropriate tribal constitution which is suitable for secretarial approval is binding 
on both the Tribe and the United States because it expresses the relationship that 
exists between a Federally-recognized tribe and the Federal Government. On the 
other hand, a constitution which is inadequate or based on factual and legal 
inaccuracies has doubtful status because it is neither an expression of the terms of 
the Federal/tribal relationship nor can it bind or involve both parties equally. The 
Poarch Band of Creek Indians cannot bind the Federal Government in any agreement 
by the unilateral dissemination of the July 1 document which purports to be the 
Band's constitution.

Please open discussions with the Poarch Band about the proposed modified constitution 
we recommended and sent to you under cover of our letter dated July 8, 1985. 
Emphasize the benefits to the Band of having a constitution which in all its provisions 
clearly expresses and encompasses the terms of the Federal/tribal relationship. If 
the Secretary has not approved an appropriate constitution, he is not bound by the 
terms of such a document. Our authorization to call a Secretarial election for the 
purpose of adopting (or rejecting) an appropriate constitution for the Poarch Band 
is hereby extended for an additional 90 days. Please provide us with a report of 
your discussion with the Band concerning the matters contained herein.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Fritz:

Please find enclosed a copy of the approved Constitution of the Poarch Band of 
Creek Indians as per Tribal Election held on June 1, 1985. As you know, a pro
posed Constitution was submitted to the Bureau almost one year ago for review and 
approval by the Secretary of Interior. Due to the lapse of time with no response 
and the necessity of the Tribe to have a governing document, the Constitutional 
Election was held, the Constitution was approved and the Tribal Council was elected 
in order that legal status would be clarified following Federal Recognition 
August 11, 1984.

Also, enclosed is a copy of the Election Procedures following the format in 25 
C.F.R, Section 81, Certification of Election Results, and Tribal Council Direc
tory. The Organizational Meeting was held on June 8, 1985. Tribal Council members 
were administered the Oath of Office and officers were elected. 

Following a review of this documentation and on behalf of the Tribal Council, I 
request that you seek approval of our approved Constitution by Mr. Hodel, Secre
tary of the Interior. Thank you for guidance and support with this very important 
matter.

Sincerely,

Eddie L. Tullis 
Tribal Chairman
