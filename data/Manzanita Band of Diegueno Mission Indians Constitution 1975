Mr. Jerome Tomhave

Superintendent, Southern California Agency

Dear Mr. Tomhave:

We have received the results of an election held on July 12, 1975, 
by the qualified voters of the Manzanita Band of Mission Indians 
under authority delegated by John O. Crow, Deputy Commissioner 
of Indian Affairs, on November 30, 1972, to the Sacramento Area 
Director and renewed by Commissioner Norri Thompson on 
March 13, 1975. It appears that the July 12, 1975, election was 
held more than ninety days after the renewal of such delegated 
authority. That authority is extended as of June 13, 1975, nunc pro 
tunc, for a period of ninety days.

As evidenced by the Certificate of results of Election signed by the 
mentors of the election board, the proposed constitution was duly 
adopted by the voters at the July 13, 1975, election.

The authority to conduct the election on the constitution was originally 
delegated to the Sacramento Area Director without the benefit of review 
by constitutional specialists on the central office staff because of the 
extraordinary circumstances existing in the central office in 
November 1972. That authority was renewed in March 1975 again without 
substantive review of the document. As a result, it appears that there 
are some ambiguities which we now recommend be removed as soon 
as possible by amending the constitution. In Article VI, Section 2, 
the meaning of "unassigned" should be certified. Under Article VII, 
Section 1, "a quorum of the council is established simply by the eligible 
voters present. This language would permit two voters to establish 
a quorum and run all the affairs of the tribe. Although the constitution 
established a three member tribal Committee, it also provided that 
the entire Tribal Council would exercise most of the power. A quorum 
provision which would permit two persons to establish a quorum 
inconsistent with the apparent desire to retain most of the governing 
power in the Triba1 Council. This should be clarified.

 In addition to these substantive difficulties, there are some minor

inconsistencies which should be cleared up. For example, Article 
III - Governing body, Section 2, describes a "Tribal Committee‚Äù 
but Article VI is headed "Powers of the Council and Business 
Committee‚Äù. If the band would like some assistance in proposing 
amendments to clarify its constitution, central office staff is 
available to work with you and the Area Director to help the band.

Since I am confident that the band will be able to work out these and 
any other remaining ambiguities, I hereby approve the Constitution 
of the Manzanita Band of Mission Indians, Manzanita Reservation, 
California and return it for delivery to the band.

Sincerely yours,
 
 

MORRIS THOMPSON

 
 Commissioner of Indian Affairs
