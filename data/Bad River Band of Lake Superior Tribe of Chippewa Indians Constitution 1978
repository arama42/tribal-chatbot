may be condemned for public purposes, such as roads, public build
ings, or other public improvements, upon payment of adequate com
pensation. It is further recognized that under existing law such 
lands may be inherited by the heirs of the present owners, whether 
or not they are members of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior 
Tribe of Chippewa Indians. Likewise, it is recognized that under 
existing law the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, 
remove restrictions upon such land, upon application by the Indian 
owner, whereupon the land will become subject to State tax and may 
then be mortgaged or sold. The right of the individual Indian to 
hold or to dispose of his land, as under existing law, shall not be 
abrogated by anything contained in this Constitution, but the owner 
of restricted land may, with the approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior, voluntarily convey his land to the Bad River Band of the 
Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians either in exchange for 
money payment or in exchange for an assignment covering the same 
land or other land, as hereinafter provided.

Sec. 2. Tribal lands of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior

Sec. 3. Tribal lands shall not be allotted to individual Indians, but 
such tribal lands as are not required for school, agency, or other ad

of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa 
Indians or may be leased or otherwise used by the Band as hereinafter 
provided.

Sec. 4. Tribal lands may be leased by the Tribal Council with the 
approval of the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with law. 
Preference shall be given, first, to cooperative associations of mem

6

bers of the Band, and, secondly, to individual Indians who are mem
bers of the Band. No lease of tribal lands to a nonmember shall be 
made by the Tribal Council unless it shall appear that no cooperative 
association of members or individual member of the Band is able and 
willing to use the land and to pay a reasonable fee for such use.

Sec. 5. In any assignment of tribal lands which are now owned by 
the Band, or which may hereafter be acquired for the Band by the 
United States or purchased by the Band out of tribal funds, or which 
may be designated for the use of the Band, preference shall be given, 
first to heads of families which are entirely landless, and second, to 
heads of families which have no allotted lands or interests in allotted 
lands, but shall have already received assignments consisting of less 
than an economic unit of agricultural land or other land or interests 
in land of equal value. such economic unit to be determined by the 
Tribal Council by ordinances. Such assignments shall be known as 
“standard assignments.”

upon his land removed, and whose land may thereafter be alienated, 
except to the Band, shall be entitled to receive an assignment of land 
as a landless Indian.

The Tribal Council may, if it sees fit, charge a fee on approval of a 

standard assignment.

Sec. 6. If any person holding a standard assignment of land shall, 
for a period of 1 year, fail to use the lands so assigned, or shall use the 
land for any unlawful purpose, his assignment may be canceled by 
the Tribal Council after due notice and opportunity to be heard. 
Such land may then be available for reassignment.

Upon the death of any Indian holding a standard assignment, his 
heirs or other individuals designated by him in writing shall have 
preference in the reassignment of the land, provided such persons are 
eligible to receive a standard assignment.

Sec. 7. Any member of the Bad River Band who owns an allotment 
of land or any share in heirship land or any deeded land, may with 
the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, voluntarily transfer his 
interest in such land, to the Band and receive therefor an assignment 
in the same land or other land of equal value or he may receive a 
proportionate share in a unit of agricultural or other lands.

Assignments made under this section shall be known as “exchange 

assignments.”

Sec. 8. Exchange assignments may be used by the assignee or 
leased by him to cooperative associations of members of the Band, to 
individual members of the Band, or if no individual member or coop
erative association of members is able and willing to rent the land at 
a reasonable fee, such assignments may be leased to non-Indians, in 
the same manner as allotted lands.

Sec. 9. Upon the death of a holder of an exchange assignment such 
lands shall be reassigned by the Tribal Council to his heirs or devisees, 
subject to the following conditions:

not a member of the Bad River Band, except that a life assignment 
may be made to the surviving spouse or child of the holder of such 
assignment.

(b) Such lands may not be reassigned to any heir or devisee who 

already owns or holds more than an economic unit of land.

units too small for convenient management, and no assignment shall 
be subdivided into units smaller than 2 acres, except that land used 
for buildings or other improvements may be divided to suit the con
venience of the parties. Where it is impossible to divide the land 
properly among the eligible heirs or devisees, the Tribal Council may 
issue to the eligible heirs or devisees interests in tribal lands or 
property of the same value as the assignment of the decedent.

(d)  If there are no eligible heirs or devisees of the decedent, the 

land shall be eligible for assignment the same as other tribal lands.

Sec. 10. Improvements of any character made upon assigned land 
may be willed to and inherited by members of the Bad River Band. 
When improvements are not possible of fair division, the Tribal

vide, for the benefit of such heirs. No permanent improvements may 
be removed from any tribal or assigned land without the consent of 
the Tribal Council.

Sec. 11. No member of the Bad River Band may use or occupy 

tribal lands except under an assignment or lease.

Sec. 12. Tribal land which is not assigned, including tribal timber 
reserves, shall be managed by the Tribal Council for the benefit of 
the members of the entire Band, and any cash income derived from 
such land shall accrue to the benefit of the Band as a whole. All 
action of the Tribal Council with respect to such lands shall be in 
conformity with departmental regulations for protection of Indian 
range and timber resources authorized by section 6 of the Act of June

Sec. 13. Tribal funds may be used, with the consent of the Secre

tary of the Interior, to acquire land for the Bad River Band.

ing. Such applications shall be submitted to the Tribal Council at

date for hearing, advising both the applicant and the objector. The
